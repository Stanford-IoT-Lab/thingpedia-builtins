# Built-in interfaces in ThingEngine

ThingPedia is the distributed open source platform for IoT rules, and
ThingEngine is the workhorse behind it, capable of running the rules.
Anyone can contribute the interface code to access any device or web
service to ThingPedia.

This package contains interfaces that are always preloaded
in every ThingEngine installation, and on which ThingEngine
relies for correct operation.

This package is part of Open Thing Platform a research project led by
prof. Monica Lam, from Stanford University.  You can find more
information [here](https://thingengine.stanford.edu/about).
